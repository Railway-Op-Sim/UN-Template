#                                                                                                                      #
#   The following file outlines the standard for the 'rail_project.toml' file which can be included within ROS         #
#   simulation repositories as a means of providing additional information to be read by APIs.                         #
#   Inclusion of such a file is recommended, most keys are optional however the more you provide the more useful the   #
#   metadata is to potential API systems.                                                                              #
#                                                                                                                      #
#   Inclusion of the 'rly_file' and 'ttb_files' keys are paramount, as they connects this metadata file with the       #
#   simulation itself and can help confirm the expected route is installed, as well as provide a bridge between        #
#   a route and its timetables. If there are any sessions these should be specified with the `ssn_files` key.          #
#                                                                                                                      #
#   NOTE: Personal information such as email or social network handles are not included under the definitions of a     #
#   route metadata file.                                                                                               #

# Railway Operation Simulator Template Map 
A brief description of what the map represents, including era, whether the route is fictional and the level of difficulty.

**NOTE: Asynchronous route building is NOT supported, `.rly` files are not designed such that two versions can be combined by git. For route development contribution you must instead alternate between contributor making sure to pull the latest version before adding to it yourself.**

|[Edit this README and Remove the following information tables] This repository should contain ultimately:|
|:-------|
| The name of your repository should follow convention of `<2 letter country code>-<name of route>`, e.g. `US-NorthEastCorridor`.|
| An image of the route in BMP format within the `Images` folder.|
| The completed railway `.rly` file or if in development `.dev` file in the `Railway` folder.|
| At least one complete timetable within the `Program_Timetables` folder.|
| At least one session for each timetable, with preferred directions set placed in the `Sessions` folder.|
| Documentation describing background to the route and operations tips within the `Documentation` folder. This can include any maps/useful information as well. The recommended format for the documentation is PDF to be universally accessible, an optional template has been added for ease.|
| Optionally a `Signal.hnd` file as a hint to what side signals are traditionally placed on the route.|
| Update the metadata file `Metadata/<route-name>.toml` which will be generated by the CI within the repository. Descriptions of recognised keys are given in the section below.|
| The table below, image of the state of the map, and the data sources should be updated regularly. In the table the statuses of not completed, completed and needs verification are represented by the icons:<br>:heavy_check_mark: :x: :grey_question:|

| **Metadata File Format** |
|---|
| The following outlines the keys of the `Metadata/<route-name>.toml` to be included within the repository. A starting file will be generated by the CI system after a commit is pushed.<br>Inclusion of the `rly_file` and `ttb_files` keys are paramount, as they connect the metadata file with the simulation itself and can help confirm the expected route is installed, as well as provide a bridge between a route and its timetables. If there are any sessions these should be specified with the `ssn_files` key. <br><br>**NOTE**: Personal information such as email or social network handles are not included under the definitions of a route metadata file. An example completed metadata file can be found [here](https://github.com/Railway-Op-Sim/BE-Anterwerpen-Centraal/blob/master/Metadata/Antwerpen_Centraal.toml)|
